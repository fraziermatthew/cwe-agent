  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly pertains to the security of web applications, which is a key focus of the course. It is appropriate for the undergraduate level as students should understand CSRF vulnerabilities. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure but introduces a new endpoint that could lead to CSRF risks if not handled properly. This provides a strong pedagogical value, as it encourages students to learn about securing web applications against CSRF attacks."
