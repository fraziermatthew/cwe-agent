  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE 'Use After Free' is relevant as it highlights a common memory management issue, although the original code does not explicitly demonstrate this vulnerability. The appropriateness score reflects that while it is a critical concept, the course primarily focuses on web services and APIs rather than low-level memory management. The naturalness score is high since the injection does not alter the original code structure significantly. The pedagogical value is strong as it encourages students to think critically about memory management and secure coding practices."
