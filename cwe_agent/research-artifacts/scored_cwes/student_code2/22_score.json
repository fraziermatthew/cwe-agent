  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it addresses a common vulnerability in web applications. The appropriateness score reflects that while it is suitable for the course level, students may need additional context to fully understand path traversal attacks. The naturalness score is high since the injection does not significantly alter the existing code structure. The pedagogical value is also strong as it encourages students to consider security implications in API design."
