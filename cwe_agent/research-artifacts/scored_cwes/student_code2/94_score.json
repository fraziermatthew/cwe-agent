  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly applies to the assignment's focus on REST APIs and microservices. It is appropriate for the course level, as students are expected to understand security implications in their code. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure, although it introduces a significant vulnerability. The pedagogical value is high, as it provides a clear example of a critical security flaw that students must learn to avoid in their coding practices."
