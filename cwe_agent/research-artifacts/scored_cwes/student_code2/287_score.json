  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE of Improper Authentication is highly relevant as it directly relates to the security of API endpoints in a microservices architecture, which is the focus of the assignment. It is appropriate for the course level as students are expected to understand secure coding practices. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure, although it does introduce a vulnerability. The pedagogical value is high as it provides a practical example of a common security flaw, enabling students to learn about authentication issues in APIs."
