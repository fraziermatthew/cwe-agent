  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly addresses a security vulnerability that can arise in web applications, especially in the context of microservices. It is appropriate for the course level as students are expected to understand security implications when designing and implementing APIs. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure without altering its original logic. Furthermore, this example provides significant pedagogical value by highlighting the importance of secure file handling and encouraging students to think critically about potential vulnerabilities in their code."
