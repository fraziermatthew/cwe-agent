  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE of Improper Input Validation is highly relevant to the assignment as it directly relates to the handling of user inputs in a web service. It is appropriate for the course level, as students are expected to understand and implement secure coding practices. The injection fits naturally into the existing code without altering its structure significantly. This example provides a strong pedagogical value by highlighting a common security flaw, encouraging students to think critically about input validation and security in API development."
