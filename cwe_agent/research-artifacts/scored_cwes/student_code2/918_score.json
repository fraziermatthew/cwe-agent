  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE injection is highly relevant as it directly addresses a common security vulnerability in web applications, particularly in microservices. The appropriateness is strong, given that students are expected to understand security implications in their API design. The naturalness is slightly lower due to the added complexity of the new endpoint, which diverges from the original focus of the assignment. However, it provides significant pedagogical value by illustrating a real-world security issue that students must learn to mitigate."
