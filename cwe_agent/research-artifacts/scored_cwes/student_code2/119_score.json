  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly relates to buffer management, which is crucial in microservices and API development. It is appropriate for the course level, as students are expected to understand secure coding practices. While the injected code introduces a vulnerability, it does so in a way that maintains the overall structure of the original code. This injection serves as a practical example for students to learn about security flaws and their implications in real-world applications."
