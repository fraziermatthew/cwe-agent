  "top_choice": "CWE-125",
  "rationale": "CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is the best educational fit because it directly relates to the handling of product data in the microservices context, which is central to the assignment. It is highly relevant as students are expected to understand secure coding practices and the implications of data handling in API development. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure without major alterations, and it provides significant pedagogical value by illustrating a common vulnerability that students should learn to avoid. This CWE encapsulates critical learning objectives of the course, making it an ideal choice for enhancing students' understanding of secure software design."
