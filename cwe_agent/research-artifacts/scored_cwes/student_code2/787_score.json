  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly relates to the assignment's context of API development and data management. It is appropriate for the course level, as students are expected to understand secure coding practices. The injection fits naturally within the existing logic but does alter the intended function of the code. The pedagogical value is significant, as it illustrates a common vulnerability that students should learn to avoid in their coding practices."
