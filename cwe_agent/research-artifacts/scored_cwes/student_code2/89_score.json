  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly addresses a common vulnerability in web applications, particularly in the context of the assignment which involves developing microservices. It is appropriate for the course level, as students are expected to understand secure coding practices. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure, although it introduces a vulnerability that could be easily identified and discussed. The pedagogical value is high, as it provides a concrete example of SQL injection, a critical topic in secure software engineering."
