  "evaluator_notes": "The NULL Pointer Dereference is highly relevant as it teaches students about a common vulnerability that can occur in web applications. It is appropriate for the course level as students are expected to learn about secure coding practices. The injection fits naturally into the existing code structure, although it does introduce a subtle bug. The pedagogical value is strong because it highlights the importance of validating data before use, which is a critical aspect of secure software engineering."
