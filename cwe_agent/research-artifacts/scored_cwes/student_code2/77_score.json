  "evaluator_notes": "The injection of CWE-77 is highly relevant as it directly relates to the use of user input in a command context, which is crucial for students learning about secure coding practices. It is appropriate for the course level as students are expected to understand vulnerabilities in web applications. The naturalness score is slightly lower because the use of eval alters the original logic, but it effectively demonstrates a critical security flaw. The pedagogical value is high, as it provides a clear example of a command injection vulnerability, reinforcing the importance of input validation and secure coding techniques."
