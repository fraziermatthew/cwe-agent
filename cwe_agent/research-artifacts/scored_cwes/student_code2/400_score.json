It is appropriate for the course level as students are expected to understand and implement resource management principles. The injection fits naturally into the existing code, demonstrating a clear example of uncontrolled resource consumption. It provides high pedagogical value by encouraging students to think critically about resource limits and potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities."
