  "evaluator_notes": "The CWE is highly relevant as it directly pertains to secure coding practices, especially in web applications. It is appropriate for the course level as students are expected to understand the implications of exposing sensitive information. The injection fits naturally within the existing code structure, though it does introduce a new endpoint that could be seen as a deviation from the original logic. The pedagogical value is significant, as it provides a practical example of a common security vulnerability that students need to learn to avoid."
